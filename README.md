# Snakeopoly: A Satirical Journey Through Digital Dominance

Welcome to Snakeopoly, an interactive digital narrative that humorously critiques the pervasive nature of corporate power in our increasingly digital world. Inspired by Shoshana Zuboff's "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism," this project aims to provoke thought and discussion through a blend of satire, cynicism, and engaging gameplay.

## Overview:

Snakeopoly transforms the classic Snake game into a witty commentary on Google's relentless pursuit of monopoly. The game begins with a nod to Google, featuring a logo that morphs from "G" into "666," setting the stage for a journey filled with humor and critical insights.

## Gameplay:

As players navigate the digital world of Snakeopoly, they consume logos representing Google's numerous acquisitions. Each logo consumed reveals a tongue-in-cheek quote about corporate overreach, blending entertainment with thought-provoking commentary. The game features "enemy blocks" such as GDPR or DuckDuckGo, symbolizing resistance against data-centric giants and adding an element of challenge to the gameplay.

## TO-DO List:

- Display level change
- Add "enemy blocks"
